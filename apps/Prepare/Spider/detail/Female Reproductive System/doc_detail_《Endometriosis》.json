Validity of the pregnancy checkbox on death certificates in four states, and characteristics associated with pregnancy checkbox errors.", "references": null, "topic": "Health Problems in Pregnancy", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nMaternal mortality rates in the United States appear to be increasing. One potential reason may be increased identification of maternal deaths after the addition of a pregnancy checkbox to the death certificate. In 2016, 4 state health departments (Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio) implemented a pregnancy checkbox quality assurance pilot, with technical assistance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The pilot aimed to improve accuracy of the pregnancy checkbox on death certificates and resultant state maternal mortality estimates.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo estimate the validity of the pregnancy checkbox on the death certificate, and to describe characteristics associated with errors using 2016 data from a 4-state quality assurance pilot.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nPotential pregnancy-associated deaths were identified by linking death certificates with birth or fetal death certificates from within 1 year preceding death or by pregnancy checkbox status. Death certificates that indicated that the decedent was pregnant within 1 year of death via the pregnancy checkbox, but that did not link to a birth or fetal death certificate, were referred for active follow-up to confirm pregnancy status by either death certifier confirmation or medical record review. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used to examine the distributions of demographic characteristics by pregnancy confirmation category (confirmed pregnant, confirmed not pregnant, and unable to confirm). We compared the proportion confirmed pregnant and confirmed not pregnant within age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier type categories using a Wald test of proportions. Binomial and Poisson regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios for having an incorrect pregnancy checkbox (false positive, false negative) by age group, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier type.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 467 potential pregnancy-associated deaths, 335 (72%) were confirmed pregnant via linkage to a birth or fetal death certificate, certifier confirmation, or review of medical records. A total of 97 women (21%) were confirmed not pregnant (false positives) and 35 (7%) were unable to be confirmed. Women confirmed pregnant were significantly younger than women confirmed not pregnant (P < .001). Deaths certified by coroners and medical examiners were more likely to be confirmed pregnant than confirmed not pregnant (P = .04). The association between decedent age category and false-positive status followed a dose-response relationship (P < .001), with increasing prevalence ratios for each increase in age category. Death certificates of non-Hispanic black women were more likely to be false positive, compared with non-Hispanic white women (prevalence ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.01, 1.96). The sensitivity of the pregnancy checkbox among these 4 states in 2016 was 62% and the positive predictive value was 68%.\nCONCLUSION:\nWe provide a multi-state analysis of the validity of the pregnancy checkbox and highlight a need for more accurate reporting of pregnancy status on death certificates.

Critical efforts to reduce maternal mortality include patient risk stratification and system-level quality improvement efforts targeting specific aspects of clinical care. These efforts are important for addressing the causes of an individual's risk, but research to date suggests that individual risk factors alone do not adequately explain between-group disparities in pregnancy-related death by race, ethnicity, or geography. The holistic review and multidisciplinary makeup of maternal mortality review committees make them well positioned to fill knowledge gaps about the drivers of racial and geographic inequity in maternal death. However, committees may lack the conceptual framework, contextual data, and evidence base needed to identify community-based contributing factors to death and, when appropriate, to make recommendations for future action. By incorporating a multileveled, theory-grounded framework for causes of health inequity, along with indicators of the community vital signs, the social and community context in which women live, work, and seek health care, maternal mortality review committees may identify novel underlying factors at the community level that enhance understanding of racial and geographic inequity in maternal mortality. By considering evidence-informed community and regional resources and policies for addressing these factors, novel prevention recommendations, including recommendations that extend outside the realm of the formal health care system, may emerge.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although rates of Zika virus infection have decreased in the United States, obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers should continue to assess their patients for potential exposure based on travel or sexual history and test symptomatic patients with possible exposure and pregnant women with ongoing exposure regardless of symptoms in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations.

If obstetrician-gynecologists or other health care providers identify a patient who has possibly been exposed to the Zika virus and may require testing, they should contact their local or state health department for assistance.

The leading medical causes of maternal mortality include cardiovascular disease, infection, and common obstetric complications such as hemorrhage and vary by timing relative to the end of pregnancy. Although specific modifications in the clinical management of some of these conditions have been instituted, more can be done to improve the system of care for high-risk women at facility and population levels. The goal of levels of maternal care is to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, including existing disparities, by encouraging the growth and maturation of systems for the provision of risk-appropriate care specific to maternal health needs. To standardize a complete and integrated system of perinatal regionalization and risk-appropriate maternal care, this classification system establishes levels of maternal care that pertain to basic care (level I), specialty care (level II), subspecialty care (level III), and regional perinatal health care centers (level IV). The determination of the appropriate level of care to be provided by a given facility should be guided by regional and state health care entities, national accreditation and professional organization guidelines, identified regional perinatal health care service needs, and regional resources. State and regional authorities should work together with the multiple institutions within a region, and with the input from their obstetric care providers, to determine the appropriate coordinated system of care and to implement policies that promote and support a regionalized system of care. These relationships enhance the ability of women to give birth safely in their communities while providing support for circumstances when higher level resources are needed.

Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to estimate the effect of any marijuana use on the primary composite outcome. The effect of marijuana exposure was also estimated for self-reported use, toxicology-detected use, and multiple use detected by toxicology.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:\nThe primary composite outcome included spontaneous preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, stillbirth, or small for gestational age.\nRESULTS:\nOf 1206 pregnant young women, 17.5% (n = 211) used marijuana. Among the women who used marijuana, 8.5% (n = 18) were identified by self-report alone, 63% (n = 133) by urine toxicology alone, and 28.4% (n = 60) by both. Urine toxicology testing results were available for 1092 (90.5%) births. The composite outcome occurred more frequently in pregnancies exposed to marijuana (46 versus 34%, P < 0.001). This remained significant after adjusting for race/ethnicity and tobacco in the multivariable model (adjusted OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.09-2.05). When marijuana exposure was defined by self-report only, the association with adverse pregnancy outcome became non-significant (adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62-1.64).\nCONCLUSION:\nIn a population of young women with nearly universal biological sampling, marijuana exposure was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The heterogeneity of findings in existing studies evaluating the impact of marijuana on mothers and neonates may result from the incomplete ascertainment of exposure.\nTWEETABLE ABSTRACT:\nMarijuana use, as detected by universal urine testing, was associated with a composite adverse pregnancy outcome among young mothers.\n© 2019 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.15885", "authors": ["Rodriguez CE", "Sheeder J", "Allshouse AA", "Scott S", "Wymore E", "Hopfer C", "Hermesch A", "Metz TD"], "publication": "BJOG. 2019 Nov;126(12):1491-1497. doi: 10.1111/1471-0528.15885.

Short-term neonatal outcomes, such as lower birth weight and neonatal abstinence syndrome, are the most well-recognized outcomes. However, knowledge gaps exist regarding longer-term neurocognitive and mental health outcomes. In this article, we summarize an expert panel discussion that was held in April 2018 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and attended by national experts in the field of perinatal opioid exposure and its impact on child development. Despite the challenges with research in this area, there is emerging literature revealing an association between neonates exposed to opioids in utero and longer-term adverse neurocognitive, behavioral, and developmental outcomes. Although adverse sequalae may not be apparent in the neonatal period, they may become more salient as children develop and reach preschool and school age. Multiple variables (genetic, environmental, and biological) result in a highly complex picture. The next steps and strategies to support families impacted by opioid use disorder are explored. Model programs are also considered, including integrated care for the child and mother, parenting supports, and augmentations to home visiting.\nCopyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-0514", "authors": ["Larson JJ", "Graham DL", "Singer LT", "Beckwith AM", "Terplan M", "Davis JM", "Martinez J", "Bada HS"], "publication": "Pediatrics. 2019 Aug;144(2). pii: e20190514. doi: 10.1542/peds.2019-0514.

We identified severe maternal morbidity using an algorithm comprising diagnoses and procedures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and used log-binomial regression models to examine the relative risk (RR) of severe maternal morbidity for stillbirth compared with live birth deliveries, adjusting for maternal demographic, medical, and obstetric characteristics. We also examined severe maternal morbidity prevalence by cause of fetal death among stillbirth deliveries.\nRESULTS:\nThe prevalence of severe maternal morbidity for stillbirth and live birth was 578 and 99 cases per 10,000 deliveries, respectively. After adjusting for maternal demographic, medical, and obstetric characteristics, the risk of severe maternal morbidity among stillbirth deliveries was more than fourfold higher (adjusted RR 4.77; 95% CI 4.53-5.02) compared with live birth deliveries.

The principal aspects addressed in the present study were: diagnosis, management, and classification of CUA, their impact on fertility and coexistence with endometriosis.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:\nEndometriosis and CUA are frequently detected in the exploration of infertility, because both of these are liable to impair fertility. Endometriosis is associated with obstructive anomalies and nonobstructive malformations, especially those concerning the septate uterus. The diagnosis and management of CUA have been discussed for several years. Various classification systems have been proposed.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe analysis of the existing literature has revealed the absence of any consensus about the management, diagnosis, and classification of CUA, especially with regard to the septate uterus. We need to find and speak a common language in order to avoid inappropriate or unnecessary surgery and optimize the individual patient's treatment.

Endometriosis may origin from Müllerian or non-Müllerian stem cells including those from the endometrial basal layer, Müllerian remnants, bone marrow, or the peritoneum. The innate ability of endometrial stem cells to regenerate cyclically seems to play a key role, as well as the dysregulated hormonal pathways. The presence of such cells in the peritoneal cavity and what leads to the development of endometriosis is a complex process with a large number of interconnected factors, potentially both inherited and acquired. Genetic predisposition is complex and related to the combined action of several genes with limited influence. The epigenetic mechanisms control many of the processes involved in the immunologic, immunohistochemical, histological, and biological aberrations that characterize the eutopic and ectopic endometrium in affected patients.

The three specific aims of treatment in adolescents with endometriosis and endometriomas are control of symptoms, prevention of further progression of the disease as well as preservation of fertility. Increasing evidence demonstrates association between ovarian endometriosis and ovarian cancer. In the present mini-review, we draw the particular attention of clinicians to such a possibility, even if relatively infrequently reported.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839067/", "authors": ["Gałczyński K", "Jóźwik M", "Lewkowicz D", "Semczuk-Sikora A", "Semczuk A"], "publication": "J Ovarian Res. 2019 Nov 7;12(1):104. doi: 10.1186/s13048-019-0582-5."}, {"title": "Dysregulated Expression of Long Noncoding RNAs in Endometriosis.", "references": null, "topic": "Endometriosis", "abstract": "Abstract\nEndometriosis is a common debilitating gynecologic disease. Almost 10% of reproductive-age women are affected by this disease; they commonly suffer pelvic pain and/or infertility. Early diagnosis of this multifactorial disease remains difficult because its etiology is not clear and the early symptoms are nonspecific. In addition, many reproductive-age women are unwilling to undergo invasive laparoscopic surgery because of the possibility of decreasing fertility. Thus, identifying biomarkers for the early diagnosis of endometriosis a key focus of current research. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding transcripts that have length of > 200 nucleotides and lack protein-coding ability but still influence gene expression in various ways. With advances in genome-wide analysis, researchers have determined that lncRNAs play an important role in many human diseases, particularly tumors. Moreover, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis has been continually recognized. In this review, we discuss the status of current research on dysregulated lncRNAs and their roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We aim to stimulate new investigations toward the identification of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and therapy of this long-term gynecological disease.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2019026460", "authors": ["Zhang XY", "Zheng LW", "Li CJ", "Xu Y", "Zhou X", "Fu LL", "Li DD", "Sun LT", "Zhang D", "Cui MH"], "publication": "Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr. 2019;29(2):113-121. doi: 10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2019026460."}, {"title": "Ultrasound Imaging in Endometriosis.", "references": null, "topic": "Endometriosis", "abstract": "Abstract\nUltrasound examination is an indisputable imaging method in the diagnosis of endometriosis, as the first step in the detection, as the fundamental tool in planning the management, and as the best diagnostic instrument during surveillance of affected women.

Fibrotic tissue consists of extracellular matrix proteins, regulated by transcriptional factors promoting cell proliferation and survival. Periostin is one of the putative key extracellular matrix proteins. This study aimed to determine whether transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is involved in the development of endometriosis as an upstream regulatory gene of periostin. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples [normal endometrium of women without endometriosis; eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis; ovarian endometriosis (OE); and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)] and respective cells were analyzed. Basal, transiently stimulated, and knocked down periostin and TCF21 concentrations in stromal cells of women with or without endometriosis were examined. Periostin and TCF21 expressions were undetected in normal endometrium of women without endometriosis, weakly positive in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis, moderately positive in OE, and strongly positive in DIE. Type 2 helper T-cell cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-β1) increased the mRNA expression of periostin and TCF21. These cytokines, periostin, and TCF21 colocalized in the stroma of OE and DIE. siRNA against human TCF21 gene suppressed periostin expression. Transfection of TCF21 plasmid vector into stromal cells of women without endometriosis, which originally expressed neither periostin nor TCF21, resulted in TCF21 and periostin expression. TCF21 and periostin are involved in the regulation of fibrosis in endometriosis. TCF21 may be a promising therapeutic target and biomarker in endometriosis.\nCopyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We have assessed the potential accuracy and utility for diagnosis of endometriosis.\nMETHODS:\nWe searched many bases to identify the included literature, which included English bases, such as, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library and Chinese bases, for instance, CNKI, Wang Fang, VIP, DuXiu, ChaoXing. We also calculated the general sensitivity and specificity, negative likelihood ratio, positive likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, ROC curve plotting and so on with Stata 15. I2 could test the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis, the funnel plot valuated whether meta-analysis had a publication bias. Regression analysis could explore heterogeneity in studies.\nRESULT:\nComprehensive reading and integrating extracted data, we included 11 published papers. The total number of people included in the case group was 453, and the control group was 362. We, respectively, calculated the general sensitivity and general specificity which were 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.85) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.82) by bivariate analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89). There was significant heterogeneity in studies which is I2 = 89.62% (95% CI 87.41%-91.83%). In addition, the results of meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that the heterogeneity might come from gold standard, evaluation standard, experimental group size, experimental sample and race CONCLUSION: The circulating non-coding RNAs have great ability of diagnosing endometriosis as non-invasive markers which were performed robustly and accurately.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-019-05290-x", "authors": ["Li Y", "Chen Q"], "publication": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2019 Nov;300(5):1099-1112. doi: 10.1007/s00404-019-05290-x.
